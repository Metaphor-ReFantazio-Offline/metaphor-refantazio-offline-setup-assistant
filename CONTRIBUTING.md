## üîÑ Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Stable, production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name`: New features
- `bugfix/issue-description`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-fix`: Emergency fixes

### Workflow

1. **Create Issue**: Discuss changes before starting
2. **Create Branch**: From `develop` for features, `main` for hotfixes
3. **Develop**: Make your changes with tests
4. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass
5. **Document**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Submit PR**: Against appropriate base branch

## üìù Style Guidelines

### Code Style

#### General Principles
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns
- **Performance**: Consider gaming performance requirements
- **Cross-platform**: Ensure compatibility across OS

#### Naming Conventions
```python
# Variables and functions: snake_case
game_config = load_configuration()
def setup_display_mode():
    pass

# Classes: PascalCase
class GameConfigManager:
    pass

# Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
DEFAULT_RESOLUTION = "1920x1080"
```

#### Comments
- Explain **why**, not what
- Use docstrings for functions/classes
- Add TODOs for future improvements

```python
def optimize_graphics_settings(hardware_info):
    """
    Automatically configure graphics settings based on hardware.
    
    Args:
        hardware_info (dict): System hardware information
        
    Returns:
        dict: Optimized graphics configuration
        
    Note:
        This function prioritizes stability over maximum quality
        to ensure smooth gameplay on various hardware configurations.
    """
    # Use conservative settings for older GPUs
    if hardware_info['gpu_year'] < 2020:
        return conservative_settings()
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Consider different skill levels
- Test all instructions
